          <h3>C# Web Development</h3>
          <p>In 2021 I enrolled in the Software Engineering program at SoftUni with C#. Throughout the courses, I've
            learned about linear data structures and multidimensional and associative arrays. Also, how to work with
            Objects and Classes, basic OOP principles, and Unit Testing. </p>

          <h3>Javascript Advanced</h3>
          <p>As part of the Software Engineering program I've completed the JS Advanced module in which I've learned
            about DOM Manipulation and Events, HTTP Requests, and REST Services as well as asynchronous programming and
            how to create Single-Page Applications using Javascript.</p>

          <h3>MS SQL</h3>
          <p>Currently, I'm enrolled in the C# Database module where we learn how to work with relational databases,
            and how to manipulate, save and extract data. In the second module of this course, I'll be learning Entity
            Framework Core.</p>

          <h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
          <p>Although not part of the main SoftUni program of Software Engineering I've learned basic HTML and CSS
            through some Udemy courses and a lot of YouTube and Google so I can create this page. I found that I
            really like creating something visually beautiful and I'd like to learn more about these technologies
            (i.e. how the hell to move the bloody 'CONTACT ME' button to be in the light-blue section below.)

          <h3>Education</h3>
          <p>After graduating high school with an orientation to foreign languages I got a Bachelor's Degree in
            Management
            from the University of Economics in Varna, Bulgaria. I've learned a lot about organizing and maintaining a
            successful business, how to be an efective leader and how to motivate others.</p>

          <h3>Work</h3>
          <p>While studying at University I took advantage of the Work and Travel program and worked for a summer in the
            The US, which sparked my love for traveling. After graduating I signed up for casino dealer training and
            shortly
            after signed on my first cruise ship. In 7 years I've done 7 contracts across 11 different ships and 4
            different cruise lines. I've visited 79 countries, worked with a crew of more than 80 nationalities, and
            made
            lifelong friendships.
          </p>
          <p>Although being a casino dealer is not a transferable skill, working on board has taught me to be
            responsible, disciplined, and respectful and to always strive to be better. Also, how to be a team player,
            how to
            adapt to an ever-changing environment, and to provide excellent custommer service. If you don't believe me,

          <h3 class="multi-img">2004-Present</h3>
          <p>Hotel Perla is a family-owned and operated business that's been in my family for nearly 20 years. I've been
            a
            part of every aspect of running a small business, from accounting to maintenance to managing people and
            providing great service to our customers. This experience has given me a unique perspective that I've
            tried to apply to every other job I've had. I always try to see things from the employer's point of view
            instead of solely from the employee's perspective. I can truly understand and can relate to the challenges,
            stresses, highs, and lows involved in running a business.
